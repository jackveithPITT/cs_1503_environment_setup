    "Machine Learning interests me because it is astoundinf to think about how we programmed a learning process in what is essentially rocks. I think the intersection of data science and computer science is very interesting. Machine learning can utilize **incomprehensible** amounts of data in relatively short amounts of time; time that, were a human to process the data, would amount to a **lifetime**. I think it is very interesting that we can model very complex relationships such as the English language with *mathematical functions and relations*.\n",
